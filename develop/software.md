# Software for HPC

This page contains useful links to tutorial, learning resources, benchmark and scripts for softwares usable on HPCs. Softwares are separated into broad scientific/application categories. Each tool has small numbers on its right side, indicating on which national HPC types those softwares are already installed. The symbol :snake: means that the software is available through the conda package manager for installation, for example, on the GenomeDK Type2 HPC. Remember, you can always contact an HPC front office to inquire about the installation of packages that you need for your applications.

### BEDtools :one: :snake:
Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks.

For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF. While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations on the UNIX command line.

## Development
### Dash :one: :snake:
Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytic applications. Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.

Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.

Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.
